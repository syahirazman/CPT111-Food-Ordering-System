# CPT111-Food-Ordering-System
My first simple food delivery system using C++.


Food Ordering system has two users, Restaurant Manager and Customer with the following basic process:

1. Restaurant Manager
a) Create/update menu
b) Update prices
c) Accept orders
d) Calculate total payments per order
e) Calculate estimated delivery item
f) Calculate total sales for a day

2. Customer
a) Order online
b) Make payments


This system used only basic C++ such as function, file handling, and array. Sorting algorithms and OOP are not implemented at all.
